CSE 142 AP CS A
News Site Scraper and Comparer

Our program scrapes the headlines off major news network’s homepages. Additionally, the program breaks the headlines down into individual words and compares the most frequently used words (excluding junk words like “the” and “on”) and the usage of politically relevant key words (e.g., Biden, Trump, Abortion) by each network's homepage. Finally, our program graphs out all of the data using DrawingPanel.

Using and Editing: to use my program you have to download the newest version of JDK

linked below is a guide from the UW on how to instal JDK:
